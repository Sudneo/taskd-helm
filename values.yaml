# This chart assumes the use of MetalLB or similar LB
# Note that taskd is exposed on plain TCP. It is still
# Possible to use regular ingress-controllers, but the
# implementation is implementation-specific.
# For example, for nginx-ingress-controller, the TCP-services
# configmap needs to exist (and be specific at command line)
# and it needs to container the port mapping. 
# See: https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/exposing-tcp-udp-services/
